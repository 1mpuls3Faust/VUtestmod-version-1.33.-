In 1525, during the aftermath of the Polish-Teutonic War (1519–1521), Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, and his nephew, the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach, a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern, agreed that the latter would resign his position, adopt Lutheran faith and assume the title of Duke of Prussia. Thereafter referred to as Ducal Prussia, remaining a Polish fief. Thus in a deal partially brokered by Martin Luther, Roman Catholic Teutonic Prussia was transformed into the Duchy of Prussia, the first Protestant state.

 vu_pagan.1.d:0 "Norse colonizers discovered and settled Greenland around the year 1000. Since then, a small colony on Southwestern coast has been established. It reached its peak prosperity around 13th century, after which it began slowly declining due to many reasons such as climate changes, depletion of resources, declining help from Iceland, lowered trade relations from black death and declining importance of Icelanding fish exports. After many harsh years, last remaining settlements there gave up of further continuing this agony.

From now on, Aspand ruled this land semi-independendly posing major problem to Qara Qoyunlu. Despite many pitty conflicts and battles, the rebelion is sill going on and old Aspand still controlls the majority of southern territories.

The Musha'sha'iyya were a Shiite sect founded and led by Muhammad ibn Falah, an Iraqi-born theologian who believed himself to be the earthly representative of Ali and the Mahdi messiah. Beginning in 1436, ibn Falah spread his messianic beliefs amongst the less powerful Arab tribes along the area of the Khuzestan and Basra, gaining converts in an attempt to forge a strong tribal alliance. In 1441, they succeeded in capturing the city of Hoveyzeh in Khuzestan, and during the following ten years the Musha'sha'iyyah increased their strength and consolidated their power in the area around the city and the Tigris. \n \nNow that Qara Qoyunlu is ridden by civil war and internal conflicts, a perfect opportunity appears to spread the power and influence of Mushasha. We can use their instability to demand land in Lower Mesopotamia that is populated by our shiite brothers. We must continue our early military ambitions that fueled by Muhammad ibn Falah's zealous millenarian theology, which significantly influences our military tactics."
 vu_middle_east.4.a:0 "By the sword of Islam, those lands are our!"
 vu_middle_east.4.tooltip:0 "We will send an envoy to Qara Qoyunlu and their rebels, demanding all of Lower Mesopotamia area that they own to be ceded to us. They will answer soon but BEWARE! This mission has average chance to succeed. If they will not submit to our demands, a war may break out!"

As the news spread, more and more Nordic people begin adopting reformed doctrine. Since it fits well with Nordic culture, there is little that one can do to stop it... at least for now. While more people move there to seek shelter or preach about new ideas, we can only watch as the whole region sweeps out of control from corrupt Papacy and bishops. Truly turbulent times are ahead for this Peninsula."

Byzantines control a strip of land from Selymbria to Mesembria they took some time ago while we were occupied by important matters. Now that their last hopes from european crusaders seem futile, we are in right position to demand those lands back, right where they rightfully belong. After all, even if they disagree, we will have valid justification and they cannot do much. Right?"

Rightful or not, it is obvious they want to annex those lands one way or another as they don't see us being capable of really resisting.

Enemies to the east and south... Enemies on water and land... The centuries of humiliation, decadence, failed ambitions and decay... there is not much left of us, YET we are still there. Somehow, despite all the odds, the last undisputed continuation of the Roman Empire is still holding to its last holdings in Greece and Thrace. Is truly everything lost? Our fate is not sealed yet! We may die in upcomming decade but even if we do so, shall we cling to decaying walls like a bunch of rats? Our empire may be done for soon but it is to our hands if we enter the grave blind or bearing a bloody sword. If there is a chance for the wheel of Fortuna to turn up in those final days, me must take every opportunity there is! \n \nIf we want to have a slight chance of surviving the Ottoman plague, we must take all the efforts into finding every possible mean of surviving. Take all our stuff and turn it against the enemy. Find every ally we can and unite against common threat. Find all the people we can to help us with the war efforts.

 incident_belgian_revolt_member_alert:0 "The Belgian Revolt has escalated far beyond regional unrest and has become an international crisis as nations lend their armies to each side. The newly declared Kingdom of Belgium lies within the boundaries of our Kingdom, and thus it has been argued that the King has a duty to extend Royal protection over this fledgling nation. Royalist involvement, however it manifests, is sure to alter the fate of the Belgium forever."
